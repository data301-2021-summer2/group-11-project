# **Group 11 - When will the bubble burst?**

- A very introductory analysis of the Canadian Housing Market to see if we can predict when the housing bubble might crash.

## Milestones

Details for Milestone are available on Canvas (left sidebar, Course Project) or [here](https://firas.moosvi.com/courses/data301/project/milestone01.html).

## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Researchers interest in this dataset is driven by a desire to purchase and own real-estate within the BC; specifically either the Okanagan Valley or Vancouver. As engineering students, most job opportunities are located in these regions. In the 1980s, there was a hyper-inflation of housing prices followed by a subsequent crash that took nearly 12 years to recover property values. From 2020 to 2021, YTD some areas have shown a 30-40% rise in housing prices. Similar YTD increases occured from 2020 to 2019 and 2019 to 2018. This growth is unprecedented except in the 1980s. 

Consequently, there is concern a market crash could be imminent. Recent property purchasers may be saddled with a mortgage greater than the value of the house. Additionally, purchasers would have received better property for the same dollar value or the same property at a cheaper cost had they purchasd after the crash. Consequently, research is drive by self-interest as the research team wish to answer the question "Is now a good time to invest in property?" and would like to investigate if a market crash is coming.

- Single Family
- One Storey
- Two Storey
- Townhouse
- Apartment 

# Size of Dataset

The dataset includes aggregate data for all areas across Canada and specific cities including Victoria, Greater Vancouver, Okanagan Valley, etc. 
There are 198 row entries per area or aggregate listings, 12 columns for a total of 2,376 datapoints per area. Additionally, Stat Canada has monthly Consumer Price Index values for the same monthly-periods, adding an additional 198 records for 2574 per area. This project focus is on Okanagan Valley and Greater Vancouver, this totals to 5,148 records.

Drink enough Diet Pepsi in a day to probably kill a small animal to stay awake! It'll only take years off the end of your life and those are the bad years anyways! 
- Andy McLean: I am a third year Electrical enginnering student trying to get a minor in Computer Science. I have been locked up for over a year going to school online and I believe my cat is plotting to kill me in  my sleep!!
- Abirinder Brar: I am a third year Elec Engineering student like Andy above with a business diploma from OK College. I have a wife, a 22 month old son and another baby on the way. It is believed that Andy's cat is also plotting to get me after him.
