## As Tableau is a ...piece of quality software, this file generally will not open a even when the database as been set to USE RELATIVE PATHS it uses ABSOLUTE PATHS.

## Consequently, it will try to open c:\users\wburc\documents\github\data301\group-11-project\data\processed\final.df. THIS FILE DOES NOT EXIST on your cloned respository.

## To fix this, do the following steps:

1. Data - > Add new Data Source, browse to the cloned respository directory > then /data/processed/final.DF
1. Select a name such as FinalDF Good or Final DF two.
1. Next click DATA INTERPRETER CHECKBOX on the left hand side.
1. Click on the # beside DATE column to change from ### to DATE data type
1. To any sheet. It does not matter which. On a sheet, in editing mode, in the upper-left card panel, data sources will be listed.
1. Click on FinalDF, right click and select REPLACE DATA SOURCE
1. In the first dropdown box, select finalDF and in the second drop down box, pick the DF you made.
1. Click okay.
1. Great, you're ready to view all the sheets including our dashboard on the final page.

_On a professional programming software, absolute paths SHOULD BE AN OPTION THAT WORKS._
Hashtag Tableau is Garbage for people who can't build a dashboard in excel or Python, in my opinion.
